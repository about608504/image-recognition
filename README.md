# image-recognition
This project will focus on single-target tracking in the static context. The background difference method is used to model the background and then read the image from the video stream, that is, the foreground image. The difference between the foreground image and the background image can obtain the target object entering the field of view. For the description of the target, the size of the target is expressed by the number of pixels in the target connected region, or the aspect ratio of the target region is used. The location of the target information can be used to locate the projection. Background differential method to detect moving objects fast, accurate detection, easy to implement. Through matlab serial port functions and stm32 communication, the final stepper motor control operation.
